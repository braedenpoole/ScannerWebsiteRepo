![scannerTop](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e5b88f0-cd60-402f-a4f5-0761bb5c7388)

## Description

- This is my market scanner project in which I scan and pull crypto and stock 
  data from multiple API's and show them in a visually appealing way.
  
- With this website users can quickly analyze and absorb the status of the crypto and
  stock market without maneuvering through excess ads and unnecessary information.

## Tools and Development

- Created a data visualization website using a Node.js back-end and Tailwind CSS front-end to extract and present live price data from the CoinGecko and Finnhub RESTful API's
  
- Implemented efficient API call back-end solutions that leveraged free-tier rate limits of CoinGecko and Finnhub API's while maintaining accurate and live price data for the user.
