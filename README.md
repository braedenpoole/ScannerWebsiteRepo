## Description

- This is my market scanner project in which I scan and pull crypto and stock 
  data from multiple API's and show them in a visually appealing way.
  
- With this website users can quickly analyze and absorb the status of the crypto and
  stock market without maneuvering through excess ads and unnecessary information.

## Tools and Development

- Developed a state-of-the-art data visualization website from scratch utilizing HTML,
  CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, and incorporated a back-end using Node.js to
  extract and present real-time cryptocurrency and stock data from Multiple API's.
  
- Implemented efficient API call backend solutions that leveraged free-tier usage limits
  of CoinGecko and Finnhub API's while maintaining high performance and accuracy of data.
  
- Fetched live data from the top 300 cryptocurrencies by market cap to a backend system
  that strategically manipulated and analyzed cryptocurrency statistics.
